## Requirements
Python


## Setup
- Open cfg.py and set any options you want to toggle to True or False.
- (optional) In case you only receive 'Error 403 - Forbidden' errors, try passing a ROBLOSECURITY key to the 'SecurityKey' option. Do NOT share this key with anyone.


## Options and what they do
- SkipStarterPlaces — Do not search for starter/new-user places. These games typically end with '<username>'s Place' and are never edited most of the time.
- SkipPrivatePlaces — Makes a request to verify that the place you find is open to the public. If the place is not available, a new search will be made.
- ViewPlaceInWebBrowser — If the place search was successful, a new browser tab will open that will take you to the page of the place.
